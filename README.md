# Hyperledger Fabric Digital Product Passport

## Getting started with the Fabric Digital Product Passport

To use the Fabric samples, you need to download the Fabric Docker images and the Fabric CLI tools. First, make sure that you have installed all of the [Fabric prerequisites](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prereqs.html). You can then follow the instructions to [Install the Fabric Samples, Binaries, and Docker Images](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) in the Fabric documentation. In addition to downloading the Fabric images and tool binaries, the Fabric samples will also be cloned to your local machine.

## Test network

The [Fabric test network](test-network) in the test network folder provides a Docker Compose based test network with two
Organization peers and an ordering service node. You can use it on your local machine to run the samples listed below.
You can also use it to deploy and test your own Fabric chaincodes and applications. To get started, see
the [test network tutorial](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/test_network.html).

The [Kubernetes Test Network](test-network-k8s) sample builds upon the Compose network, constructing a Fabric
network with peer, orderer, and CA infrastructure nodes running on Kubernetes.  In addition to providing a sample
Kubernetes guide, the Kube test network can be used as a platform to author and debug _cloud ready_ Fabric Client
applications on a development or CI workstation.
